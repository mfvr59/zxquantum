# ZX-Calculus
This is an attempt to provide an online as well as an application platform for everyone who is interested and is willing to start and enter the world of **Quantum Computing**. *ZX Calculus* is the main topic and an extremely newer branch of Quantum Computing, *ZX Calculus* is a graphical language that is used to solve higher order Quantum Circuits with a maximum efficiency and making the tedious and critical job extremely simple. 

## *ZX CALCULUS*
We have provided an oriented study material with detailed mathematical and theoretical model of the application of the ZX Calculus. We have devided the contents in 2 modes focusing on the Chapters where the theoretical and mathematical models of **Quantum Computing Using ZX Calculus** is explained and second where the codes for the same are explained in a self explainatory Jupyter Notebook. We are going to use PyZX to program the codes for ZX Calculus. 

## INSTALLATION 
If you wish to use PyZX as a Python module for use in other projects, we recommend installing via pip:
```
    pip install pyzx
```

PyZX has no strict dependencies, although some functionality requires numpy. PyZX is built to interact well with Jupyter, so we additionally recommend you have Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib installed.
If you wish you can install matplotlib we recommend it installing via pip:
```
    pip install matplotlib
```
If you wish to install Jupyter Notebook you can go to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download it for rnning Jupyter Notebook.

### *Context*
You can visit our [Git Hub Page](https://github.com/ZXQuantum/-ZX-Quantum-Py-) for an organised view.
The contents listed and that would be covered are -
1. [Chapters](https://github.com/ZXQuantum/-ZX-Quantum-Py-/tree/main/Chapters) explaining the theoretical and mathematical models.
2. [Codes](https://github.com/ZXQuantum/-ZX-Quantum-Py-/tree/main/Codes) codes for the same exercises are mentioned.
